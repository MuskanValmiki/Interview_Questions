#here we are sorting array by using BubbleSort

array=[3,5,2,7,6,8,4]
#in BubbleSort we will comapre each element and which one is greater than it shoould come at last in right side.
again we compare next element ,if it is small then we will do swaping and exchange the element position.
array=[3,2,5,7,6,8,4]#here we compare 5 is greater than 2 yes it is right so we change the place all are as it is.
array=[3,2,5,6,7,8,4]#here we compare 5 is greater than 7 no so we did not change but 6 is less then 7 so we change the place is.
array=[3,2,5,6,7,4,8]#here we compare 6 is greater than 7 no so no change but 8 is greater than 7 so we change tha place is.
array=[2,3,5,6,7,4,8]#here we compare 2 is less than 3 so we change and 3 is greater than 5 no so it is there only.
array=[2,3,5,6,4,7,8]#here we check 2 is greater than 3 no so no change,3 is greater than 5 no so no change,5 is greater than 6 no so no change,6 is greater than 7 no so no change but 7 is greater than 4 so we changed and 7 is greater than 8 no so no change.
array=[2,3,5,4,6,7,8]#same we compare which is greater we echange other wise no change so here we get 6 is greater than 4 so wee changed.
array=[2,3,4,5,6,7,8]# same we compare and get 5 is greater than 4 so wee changed is.
#Now if we will compare so our array already sorted so no need to sort.
# by writing the nested loop we have to compare each element.
